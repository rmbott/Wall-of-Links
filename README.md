## Description:
Display your frequently visited pages in an elegant and functional way. Namely, a wall of text. Tweak your copy and make it your browsers default homepage to visit all your frequently visited pages with one click. Requires rudimentary knowledge of HTML.

## Features:
  * Darkmode
  * It's HTML/CSS so, it can do anything HTML/CSS can. I use the following in the example:
    * headers (categories)
    * unordered lists (bullet points)
    * horizontal lines

## Instructions:
1) Save the project files to your computer. They can be found here: [https://github.com/rmbott/Wall-of-Links/](https://github.com/rmbott/Wall-of-Links/)

2) Tweak the "homepage.html" file you downloaded in step 1 with your most frequently visited pages.

3) Open the "homepage.html" file you just tweaked in your browser (Open browser, then hit [CTRL+O], then browse to the location of "homepage.html"). Once "homepage.html" is open in your browser, copy the URL in your browser's location bar.

4) Set your browser's homepage and new-tab page to the URL you copied in step 3. If your browser will not let you set a custom URL as the new-tab page, try finding a browser-plugin/browser-extension that will allow you to set a custom URLs the new-tab page.
